# Secret Santa

### What is this?
Secret Santa is a simple JavaScript program that simulates a white elephant gift exchange. My family does one of these every year so I thought I'd take a stab at programming it!

Every family member is added to a "family" array.

Family members are not allowed to gift for their significant other, so those relationships are added to a "restricted" object as key-value pairs.

After some iterative and conditional magic, we generate the assignments to the console. You can view the progress of the program in the log.

### How do I run this?
If you have node installed, run the JavaScript file from the command line. Otherwise, copy the code in the secret_santa.js file, go to jsbin, and click the "Run" button.
